# Savant-Alexa-Bridge

This project is to integrate Alexa on the Amazon Echo with Savant home automation systems.


### A few notes when creating your RacePoint config:
* TODO: Only custom workflows that you have enabled to show on the UI will work.
* Words in the name of any workflow should be separated by spaces only. 'OpenGate' should be written as 'Open Gate'.
* Service Aliases should also be named with spaces between words. 'AppleTV' should be named as 'Apple TV'.
* At this point only A/V services are supported. Environment might come later.


### Important:
* This is currently unsupported on the SCH-2000 host as there is a bug in Ruby on this host that Savant are not going to resolve. If people want support on this host, please contact me and I can give you information on opening a support case with Savant. Hopfully if enough pople complain, we can get this fixed.
