# Savant-Alexa-Bridge

This project is to integrate Alexa on the Amazon Echo with Savant home automation systems.


### A few notes when creating your RacePoint config:
* Only custom workflows that you have enabled to show on the UI will work.
* Words in the name of any workflow should be separated by spaces only. 'OpenGate' should be written as 'Open Gate'.
* At this point only A/V services are supported. Environment will come later.
