# Savant-Alexa-Bridge

This project is to integrate Alexa on the Amazon Echo with Savant home automation systems.


### A few notes when creating your RacePoint config:
* TODO: Only custom workflows that you have enabled to show on the UI will work.
* Words in the name of any workflow should be separated by spaces only. 'OpenGate' should be written as 'Open Gate'.
* Service Aliases should also be named with spaces between words. 'AppleTV' should be named as 'Apple TV'.
* At this point only A/V services are supported. Environment might come later.
